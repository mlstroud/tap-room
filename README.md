## User Stories
|  |
|--|
| :heavy_check_mark: As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent |
| - [x] As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list. |
| [x] As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page. |
| [x] As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints. |
| [x] As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0. |

## Stretch Goals
| |
|--|
| [ ] As a user, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake. |
| [ ] As a user, I want to be able to delete a keg. |
| [x] As a user, I want a keg to update to say "Out of Stock" once it's empty. |
| [x] As a user, I want kegs with less than 10 pints to include a message that says "Almost Empty" so I can try a pint before it's gone! |
| [ ]As a user, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. This could be based on their price, the style of beer, or the amount of pints left. |
| [ ]As a user, I want this application to be nicely styled. (Use stylesheets and CSS objects!) |
